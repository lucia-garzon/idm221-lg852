## Intro

Over a 10 week internship, I worked as a UI/UX Intern at Draft Studios. As part of their internship program, I was able to work on a core project in which as part of a small team I focused on identifying a problem in the tech industry, validating the problem, and building an MVP to solve it.

Together, me and my team noticed and capitalized on a need to connect parents in Philadelphia with accessible after-school programs to keep their children safe.

The solution that we came up with is PhillyReach, a program-finding desktop website for working parents in Philadelphia. As our product seeks to help low to middle-income parents find affordable programs quickly and easily, PhillyReach offers a wide variety of after-school and summer programs available for middle-grade youth in Philadelphia.  

## Process

First, I engaged in market research with my team to better identify our problem. What solutions exist to solve this need, and how can they be better accessed? There are multiple non-profit organization websites that list their educational programs in Philadelphia as well as a government website that acts as a database for after-school care in the city. However, parents complain these websites aren’t organized and streamlined enough for them to find the right program that fits their child’s needs and interests. 

After talking to parents in Philadelphia and utilizing our team’s own connections to middle schools in the area, we realized a bigger need to connect free after-school programs with working parents, who often do not have the means to pay high program fees. This is demonstrated in the user persona for PhillyReach, Laura, who is a single working mother struggling from a lack of free time and scattered resources for support. 

Our solution to this problem, PhillyReach, is a centralized program-finding website that allows parents to utilize a search bar and filtering system to navigate through affordable after-school care. From the home page’s search bar, parents are directed to the explore page containing a database of programs in Philly. Parents can freely explore the program profiles and be taken to a direct link to sign up once they click a card they are interested in. 

Overall, they can also expand on their searching through the search bar on the explore page, or the two filter options provided which customize programs based on the interest or focus area of a program, as well as how far a program is to a parent’s zip code. This is because two common factors a parent considers when applying for a program is how far it is from them, and what interest areas it provides to enrich their kids, whether it’s STEM and sports, to art and mentorship opportunities. 

While designing this website, I wanted parents to understand quickly the type of services we provide. I placed a focus on light blue and white in our branding to create a modern look and feel. Blue in particular is used on a lot of educational websites, which is why it's the main color of PhillyReach, and a prominent color explored in my Figma color styles. I also customized the website through vectors I personally made of the city’s famous icons, from the Rocky statue and the Liberty Bell to the Ben Franklin Bridge. 

From my wireframes to the final mock-up, I iteratively created an experience that would lessen the steps parents in Philly often take to find programs. With just two clicks, a parent can find a program and sign up for it through the organization website. I placed a focus on ease of use and accessibility on the website by taking into consideration the website’s fonts and font sizes, color contrast, button sizes, as well as following a grid system in the explore page. This culminated in a consistent, sleek design. 

With Figma smart animate, I was able to enhance the user’s journey by creating quick interactions that appear smoothly when the user hovers over buttons and program cards, and encourages them to explore the website further.

## Reflection

Despite the efforts I placed in this project, I feel more could be done to solve this problem. At week 9 of the design process, I met with industry professionals at Comcast as part of my internship program and I presented my work in order to receive critiques. The advice I received back was not only kind but also very insightful in ways I could have expanded on my design. 
    
The explore page could have been improved on through lists rather than a grid system of cards, by additional filters that would customize results through age group and program availability, as well as a map showing parents visually where programs are located. I was also urged to consider creating a page of additional resources to connect parents to more program finders, as well as grants and scholarships. 

**Gaining perspective from experts on this issue helped extremely, making me wish I had met with them earlier in the design process.** Although this was my first internship, and the time frame of 10 weeks I had to design and present my work felt a bit accelerated at times, I should have asked more questions early in the process to create a more informed design. If anything, this experience has taught me that the most successful products are the ones that connect people, and that that is done well by talking extensively with the people who are affected by the issue. Now more than ever I am excited by UX research and how it works to create interfaces that understand their users.

## Intro

As the final project for my UI Design class, I redesigned the website of La Michoacana, a Mexican-inspired ice cream retailer across desktop, tablet, and mobile interfaces. The original website can be found here: [Michoacana.com][6]. 

Since the company's goal is to promote the popular Mexican tradition of eating paletas (popsicles), its existing customer base is Latinos and Hispanics. I identified the target user as a Hispanic mom living in the U.S., who wants to remain connected to her culture.

## Critique

Although the website has vibrant colors that help to convey its brand identity, by the bottom half of the homepage there are too many colors to look at and the brand image gets lost in the colors of the various background images. Not enough emphasis is placed on where to buy products, as the company chooses to promote blog posts first on the homepage.

After organizing a card sort, I changed the information architecture of the website to focus more on the company’s products.

## Process

Through Figma, I redesigned new and existing pages of the website and enhanced the website’s branding overall across three interfaces. For example, I determined the two colors hot pink and bright yellow best represent the company’s brand image and strategically altered the typography of the website to better reflect the playful design of the previous website.

My user journey consists of learning about the company through an Our Story page, navigating to the Products page, exploring the Paletas page to learn about the paletas sold by this company, and finding out about how to purchase them. In my redesign, I streamlined the Product page and modernized the Paleta product pages to get the user more interested in learning more about La Michoacana’s products.

## Reflection

Overall, I am proud of how I reflected the company’s branding through playful and modern typography and creative graphical designs to define the look of the website. I learned more about Figma animations, and how to utilize them to intrigue the user. Building a responsive design in three interfaces proved exciting too since it pushed me to evaluate my redesign on a wider scale. 

If I could go back on my work, I would conduct another card sort to evaluate the information architecture of the site even further. I realized it's never wrong to engage in user testing multiple times since it produces designs better informed by their target user. I have much more to learn about how UX intermingles with UI design and I am excited about future opportunities in this field.

To further understand the interface I have redesigned and the user journey I have illustrated, I urge you to explore my prototypes on Figma.

# Inkling Interaction Design

## Intro
Throughout my 10 week Interaction Design class, I learned the importance of microinteractions supported by triggers, feedback, rules and modes and applied this knowledge to rebrand an app with newly imagined interactions. 

As a result, I gained a better understanding of how interaction design contributes to making products that understand people, increasing my interest towards creating intuitive experiences. 

## User 
First, this redesign and rebranding process began with choosing an app with q singular focus and researching its target user. Waffle, now reimagined into Inkling, is a group journaling app for couples, family and friends to collaborate and write journal entries together. 

Since Inkling targets youth and college-age adults to create shared journals, this is where Sammy comes in. As a college freshman seeking to keep friendships from high school strong, Sammy is a perfect match.

## Process
In order to reimagine the app’s common user flow of opening the app and creating and posting a new journal entry, I started with sketches for possible microinteractions to explore in my final demonstration.

What is the personality of my brand, and how did I want it to move at different touch points?

From my wireflow to my IX Flow, the UI design of my app and the path the user takes changed over time. I simplified the user flow to four tasks and experimented with different depictions for the app’s UI elements. In the high fidelity IX flow featured below I made sure to provide the feedback the app gives whenever the user presses the screen. 

While rebranding, I placed a focus on dark gray and a light teal color to create a minimal, sleek impression that still felt calming to the user to enter. With dark mode creating a tranquil space, users are encouraged to spill their thoughts freely.   

With my high fidelity UI design settled, I moved on to establishing the microinteractions I would animate by creating an interaction guide. This would make it clearer when creating translated keyframes in AfterEffects. 

Some interactions I placed a heavy focus on were ones that involved the core purpose of the app. For example, to symbolize the excitement that comes from a new idea or the frenzied feeling of wanting to jot feelings out quickly to paper, my button for making new journal entries displayed a feather pen scribbling out some writing after being pressed. While it's a small moment that is easy to disregard, it helps establish the character of the app, making it easier for the user to feel connected to it. 

Moving on to After Effects, I was determined to create a smooth depiction of a user interacting with the app that showcased its subtle microinteractions. Considering the timing, how could I quickly communicate what happens when the user opens a journal to access their entries? From start to finish, I wanted to ensure the feedback from the app was as clear and non intrusive as possible—in a way that still felt helpful—to the user.  


## Results

## Reflection
Looking back, I’m proud of the microinteractions I animated in my first use of After Effects. Timing the interactions that have the most attention became essential, and I focused quite a bit on the app’s loading screen as well as the success notification from posting an entry as an example. 

I still would improve the flow of some interactions however if I was given more time. Less class time was spent working in After Effects than I anticipated, creating some speediness in the responsiveness of the app in the beginning of the video where the user navigates through the journals. As a result, I can see the importance of timing much better now in presenting realistic user flows. I’m motivated to improve on my interaction design skills through more After Effects projects in the future!

## Intro
Over a span of 4 weeks, I collaborated with a fellow UXID student to create a **physical product** and **app prototype** that seamlessly worked together to solve a problem we identified in college students—a lack of knowledge of plant care. After some research into this topic and feedback from our professor, we determined a problem statement:

*College students need a **device** to help **take care of indoor plants**—and cultivate a relationship with nature—because they struggle to keep them alive and need to take care of plants for **mental health benefits**.​*

## Research
Using past studies and conducting a Google form survey, we identified the target user for our multimedia design were college students, who are interested in plant care for aesthetic purposes and to cultivate a relationship with nature that will improve their mental health.

Below are an empathy map and user persona I drafted to better understand the target user.

## Process
Next, we began the process of ideating and creating prototypes. In my ideations below I wanted to create a friendly, soothing app interface that would ease the user into plant care—and a creative, inexpensive idea for the physical product that would seamlessly connect to our digital solution. 

After receiving constructive feedback from our classmates and professor, our multimedia design solution was the **Best Fronds Plant Monitoring Pot** and **Best Fronds app**.

The **Best Fronds Plant Monitoring Pot** allows the user to keep track of a plant’s water and sun levels​, as well as improve the user’s stress and mood through plant interaction. Further below is our low-fidelity prototype made with simple materials.

The **Best Fronds app** prototype was produced in Figma and had two aims: to notify the user of the current state of their plant and to better the user’s mental health.

In addition to the app’s cute avatar and navigation menu, I designed a journaling feature to document the plant’s progress and allow the user to express themselves, a Plant Community page to learn more about plant care and connect with other plant lovers, and a Plant Resources page for mental health media and plant care support.

Throughout this process, I visualized and created two storyboards communicating how our products would work together, and how easily users can learn about and benefit from our design.

## Reflection
This was the first time I utilized the design thinking process to deliver a multimedia design. While I feel we were successful in executing a product that will simultaneously increase the botanical literacy of the user and their mental health, I would go back and make some improvements in our approach and final design if possible.

I would look at improving the color scheme of our app prototype to increase its readability, I think the colors may be a bit too muted. I would also delve more into market research and look into whether it would be possible to make the physical product we suggested with the target price range of the product we proposed. I would also engage in user testing with our app, to understand how a college student would interact with our prototype, and how to better improve our user interface based on that information.
