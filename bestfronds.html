                    <h2 id="bestfronds-intro">Intro</h2>
                    <p>Over a span of 4 weeks, I collaborated with a fellow UXID student to create a <b>physical product</b> and <b>app prototype</b> that seamlessly worked together to solve a problem we identified in college students—<b>a lack of knowledge of plant care</b>. After some research into this topic and feedback from our professor, we determined a <b>problem statement</b>:</p>

                    <div class="project-content-highlighted" id="bestfronds-highlighted1">
                        <p>College students need a <b>device</b> to help <b>take care of indoor plants</b>—and cultivate a relationship with nature—because they struggle to keep them alive and need to take care of plants for <b>mental health benefits</b>.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2 id="bestfronds-the-user">The User</h2>
                    <p><b>Using past studies</b> and <b>conducting a Google form survey</b>, we identified the target user for our multimedia design were college students, who are interested in plant care for aesthetic purposes and to cultivate a relationship with nature that will improve their mental health.</p>
                    <p>Below are an <b>empathy map</b> and <b>user persona</b> I drafted to better understand the target user's mindset.</p>
                    <!-- empathy map image -->
                    <!-- user persona image -->
                </section>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2 id="bestfronds-process">Process</h2>
                    <p>Next, we began the process of <b>ideating</b> and creating prototypes. In my ideations below I wanted to create a <b>friendly, soothing app interface</b> that would ease the user into plant care—and a creative, <b>inexpensive</b> idea for the <b>physical product</b> that would seamlessly connect to our digital solution.</p>
                    <!-- affinity map image -->
                    <!-- procreate sketches image -->
                    <p class="project-content-highlighted" id="bestfronds-highlighted2">After receiving <b>constructive feedback</b> from our classmates and professor, our multimedia design solution was the <b>Best Fronds Plant Monitoring Pot</b> and <b>Best Fronds app</b>.</p>

                    <!-- plant pot prototype photos -->
                    <p>The <b>Best Fronds Plant Monitoring Pot</b>> allows the user to keep track of a plant's water and sun levels, as well as improve the user's stress and mood through plant interaction. Further below is our low-fidelity prototype made with simple materials.</p>
                    <p>The <b>Best Fronds app</b> prototype was designed in Figma and had two aims: to <b>notify the user</b> of the current state of their plant and to <b>better the user's mental health</b>.</p>
                    <!-- 3 pages from best fronds app image -->

                    <p class="project-content-highlighted" id="bestfronds-highlighted3">In addition to the app's cute <b>avatar</b> and <b>navigation menu</b>, I <b>designed</b> a <b>Journaling page</b> to document the plant's progress and allow the user to express themselves, a <b>Plant Community page</b> to learn more about plant care and connect with other plant lovers, and a <b>Plant Resources page</b> for mental health media and plant care support. </p>

                    <p>Throughout this process, I designed two <b>storyboards</b> communicating <b>how our products would work together</b>, and <b>how easily users</b> can learn about and <b>benefit from our design</b>.</p>
                    <!-- storyboard 1 less color -->
                    <!-- storyboard 2 more color -->

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2 id="bestfronds-reflection">Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This was the <b>first time I utilized the design thinking process to deliver a multimedia design</b>. While I feel we were successful in creating a product that will simultaneously increase the botanical literacy of the user and their mental health, <b>I would go back and make improvements</b> in our approach and final design if I could.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I would look at <b>improving the color scheme</b> of our app prototype to <b>increase its readability</b>, the colors may be a bit too muted.</li>
                        <li>I would also <b>delve more into market research</b> and look into whether it would be possible to make the <b>physical product</b> we suggested with the target price range of the product that we proposed.</li>
                        <li>If I had more time, I would also <b>engage in user testing with our app</b>, to understand how a college student would interact with our prototype, and how to better improve our user interface based on that. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Overall, I'm grateful my Product Design class gave me the chance to tackle a problem through a multimedia design solution, and even more <b>excited</b> by the opportunities I'll have to <b>design and iterate</b> like this in the future. </p>
