# Hi there, I’m Lucia!

I am a UI designer and UX researcher based in Philadelphia and I love challenging myself to create engaging digital experiences. Currently, I’m designing and developing websites and apps as a student at Drexel University. 

In my free time, I enjoy making art, reading, traveling and watching animated movies. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
